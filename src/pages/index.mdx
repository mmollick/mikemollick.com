## Who am I?

I'm a Product Engineer & Founder.

Most recently I lead engineering at [Syrup](https://syrup.io) (backed by [High Alpha](https://www.highalpha.com/capital)), an email marketing platform for founders.

Previously I worked with [Truepill](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/truepill) (YC17), [ZoomInfo](https://zoominfo.com), and Co-founded [NeverBounce](https://neverbounce.com) (Acq. by ZoomInfo). I got my start working with the digital web agencies, Creavos (defunct) and [FORM](https://www.theformgroup.com/).
